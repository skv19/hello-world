print("	She opened her eyes to the cowering cacophonies of the empty lights. Nothing was here to be done; nothing was here to be won. Her mind was moving, shaking, turning, growing, and she was nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.")

print("	She was here to grow and be known.")

print("	Was she ever getting out of this cave?")

print("	Arianna rose to her feet and stepped away from the still-crackling fireplace. She tied her hair into a ponytail and turned to stare at the wall – the wall that somehow kept her locked away, broken, stagnant. She glared at it, shouted at it, and, finally, thanked it. Thanked it for keeping her locked away, where she wouldn’t have to be seen. Thanked it for keeping her somewhere safe, where she wouldn’t have to dream.")

print("	The Door creaked open to reveal A∂la, who opened her heart and mind and asked Arianna again why she stayed within the cave. Arianna snapped back, too quickly, that there was no way out. A∂la asked her if she was sure. Arianna said yes, she was sure, sure, sure, sure. She was nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. A∂la nodded and stepped towards the gently crackling fireplace.")

print("	“Here you are small and unknown and empty and safe,” A∂la said, quietly, growing somehow as she leaned over and made herself physically smaller. “Here you are someone and something that you can understand. Someone and something that you can comprehend.”")

print("	Arianna bunched her hands up into fists. She was trapped in this cave. She wasn’t here by her own free will. She wasn’t. It didn’t matter that she had just been whispering to the wall, thanking it, wishing it would stay, expressing gratitude for the beautiful sanctuary it had granted her through its overbearing, suffocating, crushing existence.")

print("	A∂la sighed, shrugging, growing, knowing. ")

print("	“You can leave whenever you wish, child,” she whispered, staring into the flames.")

print("	“Whenever you wish.”")
